  Pounded on heavily by Chris Torek (chris@mimsy.umd.edu, umcp-cs!chris).
  Converted to 4.3BSD Beta by Chris Torek.
  Other changes made at Berkeley, based in part on code by Kirk Smith.
  
  Converted to 4.3BSD+ 386BSD by Brad Parker (brad@cayman.com)
  Added VJ tcp header compression; more unified ioctls
  
  Extensively modified by Paul Mackerras (paulus@cs.anu.edu.au).
  Cleaned up a lot of the mbuf-related code to fix bugs that
  caused system crashes and packet corruption.  Changed pppstart
  so that it doesn't just give up with a collision if the whole
  packet doesn't fit in the output ring buffer.
  
  Added priority queueing for interactive IP packets, following
  the model of if_sl.c, plus hooks for bpf.

  This driver takes packets off the IP i/f and hands them up to a
  user process to have its wicked way with. This driver has its
  roots in a similar driver written by Phil Cockcroft (formerly) at
  UCL. This driver is based much more on read/write/poll mode of
  operation though.
