EzSEIn - Performing Sound Effects From an SE Stream 


<Description>
	In this sample program, libsein and modhsyn are used to perform sound effects. 
	This EE sample program has a corresponding IOP sample program. The two sample programs work together. 
	Note that the EE program automatically loads the IOP program, so be sure to build the IOP module (iop/sample/sound/ezsein) beforehand. 

	This sample program uses libsein to generate an se-stream on the EE, transfers that se-stream to the IOP, and finally uses modhsyn to generate sound.

	By setting the maximum number of sounds and priority for the sound effect's se-stream input port, or by setting the maximum number of sounds for all sound effects generated by the se-stream, you can guarantee that a maximum of n sounds will be available for sound effects and the remaining (48 - n) sounds will be available for other processing such as playing scores.

	To minimize traffic between the EE and IOP, the sound effect's se-stream buffer is transferred to the IOP only once per frame when a new sound effect is requested. The EE is not involved in this operation at all. modhsyn is responsible for managing the voices, and sound generation delay is suppressed as much as possible by speeding up the IOP-side loop (240 Hz). 

	EzSEIn supports split loading of BD data. Large BD data can be transferred to SPU2 local memory easing the burden on IOP memory. 

	DMA channel 1 is used to transfer BD data to SPU2 memory. (A modhsyn function on the IOP is used to specify the DMA channel.) To transfer an I/O block (sceSdBlockTrans) at the same time, make sure that the channels being used do not overlap. 

	ezmidi, a similar sample program, is also available for your reference. ezmidi uses a midi-stream to generate sounds from score data as well as produce sound effects.
